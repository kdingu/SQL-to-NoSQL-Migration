# SQL-to-NoSQL-Migration
Java program to migrate database schema and data from SQL Server to MongoDB.

This program is part of my bachelor thesis i delivered to my school for a Bachelor in Software Engineering degree.
Included in the repository is the demo database schema used on SQL Server to provide the data and schema that needs to me migrated.
MongoDB atlas can be used to create a local database and use that to connect to from the program.
